# Installation
If you want to install this project, then just install it on your computer, install the dependencies using the npm command.  
Next, in the server directory in the file pakage.jason, change the startup script start to "nodaemon server.js".  
It will also be necessary to change the link to the mongo db database in the .env file. If you don't have it, just create it, it will take a couple of minutes.  
In the case of a client, in the directory of the same name, you will also need to change the link in a file similar in name
